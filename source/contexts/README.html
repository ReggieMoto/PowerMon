        Context Readme</span></h3>
    <h3><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></h3>
    <span style="font-family: Arial;">PowerMon's console screen management is
      done using a quasi-state machine in which contexts are states, key presses
      are inputs, and...well, actions are actions. The files that comprise the
      PowerMon screen management system are:<br>
    </span>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">user_io.c/h</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">user_io_fsm.c/h</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">console_io.c/h</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">the various xxx_ctx.c/h files</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">States
          and inputs are defined in user_io_fsm as are a registration function
          for configuring a table with the inputs and actions a context
          supports, a default non-action function the table is initialized with
          at startup, and the startup initialization function. Since console
          management occurs within the context of a single thread no mutex is
          required to manage access to the resources.<br>
        </span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span>The
        call to initialize the user_io_fsm component is made at user_io thread
        initialization in user_io just before entering the thread loop.</span></p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial;">There are presently 6 user_io_fsm
      states/contexts: login (the default startup context), config (the 'top'
      level context), user, add_user, edit_user, and report. There are plans to
      implement others: one for WiFi network selection, one for device
      discovery, and one for managing the logging.<br>
      <br>
      Key presses are received in the console_io thread. Once a carriage return
      is received, the resulting string -- either a single keypress or a string
      of characters -- is sent to the user_io thread. The user_io message
      handler calls the appropriate handler for either a single keypress or for
      a string. For single key presses, the user_io_fsm is called with the
      single keypress as an input to the state machine. A lookup is done for the
      current state and input, and the resulting action is called, either a
      specific handler for the keypress or the default non-action handler.<br>
      <br>
      What's displayed on the screen is managed by the context.<br>
